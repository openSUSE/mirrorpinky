 Mirrorpinky
=============

 How it should work
--------------------

* Each user is member of a group
* Each group can have multiple servers (this is useful for cases like
  rackspace/gwdg with 3 mirrors)
* Each group can only modify/query their own servers
* Each user can query the public informations about every other mirror
  (the stuff we show on mirrors.opensuse.org)

 Things groups can do
----------------------

* They can add new mirrors
* They can remove their mirrors
* They can disable/enable their mirror
* They can edit the various urls assigned to their mirror (FTP, HTTP, RSYNC)
* They can set the priority of their mirror
  * This has to be carefully monitored, a bad mirror might set themself a very
    high priority but is actually degrading the service for openSUSE users.
* They can edit the limitations for their mirrors. This includes:
  * Limit to network/AS/country/region
  * Allow serving other countries
* They should be able to see the log of the last scan of their mirror
* They should be get notifications in case we see errors with their mirror
  * It might a good idea to add arbitrator hosts outside of our network to avoid
    issues where only our connection to them is bad.
    * I think the arbitrator becomes more important when we start notifying
      people... disabling a mirror for a few minutes in case of a problem is one
      thing ... spamming users with false alarms another.


 TODO

* how to join an existing group
